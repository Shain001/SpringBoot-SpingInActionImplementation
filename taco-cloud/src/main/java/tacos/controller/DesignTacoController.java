	Notes created by Shain:
	1. About @ModelAttribute:
		!! Can be annotated above a method or on a function parameter
	 	!! Only support @RequestMapping annotated controller
	 	!! Function:
	 	when annotated above a method:
	 		"ADD" an attribute to the model. Emphasis on Adding;
	 		Also, mention that @ModelAttribute will be called BEFORE the calling of RequestHandler. e.g. before the calling of
	 		processDesign which is annotated by @PostMapping, the @ModeleAttribute annotated method will be called first, which means
	 		the attribute will be added to the model first.
	 		For example, if one method is aiming to redirect to another page, but before that it need to print out an attribtue of the model.
	 		In this scenario, instead of adding the attribute in this method, we can return the value in the @ModleAttribtue method: like return new Taco("tacoName").
	 		Then we can print taco.name ("tacoName" will show) to the screen
	 	when annotated on a function parameter:
	 		See it as @AutoWired + @Qualifier|@Bean. i.e. "Fetch" the attribute from the model, if it is not found, use the default constructor to create an instance and add it to model.
	 		This is normally used when the Web Page has a form, the form will be packaged to the model to return to the back end controller method, in that method, we can use the returned
	 		attribtue in the model to get the data input from the user.

	 2. About @SessionAttributes:
	 	E.g. @SessionAttributes(values={"name", "age"}, types={String.class})
	 	if we annotated like this, then:
	 	1) the attribute that called name and age will be saved into the Session, which means it can share data accorss pages as long as the session not end;
	 	2) all the attribute whose value type is String will be saved to the session as well. For example, model.addAttribute(name = "notNameNethierAge" value="stringType"), this attribute will
	 	also be saved to the session, although the attribute's name "notNameNethierAge" is not in values={"name", "age"}
	 	!!!NOTE:
	 	At the recieving controller class, this annotation is also needed to be added above the class header


	 3. When use them together:
		 Take example of this class's code:
		 (1)look at method "public Taco taco()" which is annotated by @ModelAttribute("taco"). The attribute "taco" will not be added to the session, since "taco" is not specified in @SessionAttributes.
			However, the attribute "order" will be added to session, since it is in the values of @SessionAttribtues.
		 (2)look at method "private String processDesign(@Valid Taco design, Errors errors, @ModelAttribute Order order)";
			this method is accepting a form object form the front end, and at the same time, this attribute "order" will be saved into the session.
			Here the @ModelAttribute is not decalared as @ModelAttribute("order"), because if you do that there will be error. But see it same thing.

	 4. About @Valid:
		 This is to add validation to the front page.
		 In the model class, we have some validation annotations added such as @NotNull. To make it work, we need to use @Valid annotation in the controller
		 method to make the system check the validation.
		 Then, if there is an error, the error will be recorded in the "Error errors" instance, further, this "errors" instance will be passed to the front page, we can use
		 th:if="${#fields.hasErrors('name')}"
		 th:errors="*{name}">CC Num Error</span>
		 to show the message to user. the "name" is the model class's field.

	5. LomBok is not automatically newing the List<> type field, not sure why

	6. About How to add an object to Model's field that is a collection type in Thymeleaf:
		i.e., in this demo project, the Taco class has one field "List<Ingredient>". In the front page, user is using a form to pick his ingredient for the taco.
		The ingredient types is queried from database, showing all ingredients currently stored in DB. PROBLEM is that in the form's <input> tag, after user pick an ingredient,
		the form is actually saving the ingredient's id (every ingredient is an object that has a field id). However, the taco model class requires Ingredient type object. Consequently, the error shows, application clash.
		Solution:
		add a converter class. Can be seen in util package.
		The converter class needs to:
		(1) use @Component annotate;
		(2) implements Converter ==> org.springframework.core.convert.converter.Converter;
		(3) Override the convert method;
		All done, the spring will do the rest.

	7. When using the SimpleJdbcInsert to update the database:
		Note that the model's field name has to be exactly same with the schema defined in DB (not sure whether can be explicitly declared
		when they are different).
		This is not a problem if you use the JdbcTemplate.update(), since in this case you have to write the sql query yourself.

	8. More about SimpleJdbcInsert:
		How to use:
			Initiate:
			(1) Delare the SimpleJdbcInsert object as private field;
			(2) Dependency Injection for JdbcTemplate through repo's constructor, since it is still needed.
			(3) initiate the SimpleJdbcInsert object, i.e. the created private field, in the constructor:
					this.orderInserter = new SimpleJdbcInsert(jdbcTemplate).withTableName("Taco_Order").usingGeneratedKeyColumns("id");
				 This usingGeneratedKeyColumns("id"), the "id" is the column name that is autogenerated.
				 If there is no auto-generated column (normally just id), then this function can be skipped.
			Insert Data:
			(1) Create the Map<> type object:
					Map<String, Object> values = new HashMap<>();
					values.put("tacoOrder", orderId);
					values.put("taco", t.getId());
					tacoOrderInserter.execute(values);
				OR:
					Map<String, Object> values = objectMapper.convertValue(order, Map.class);

				This two ways, the difference is that for the first one, not every field of the TACO object is a column in db, so
				we have to select part of its field and put them in the values obejct. The second scenario, all the field of the order
				object are columns in the DB, so we can just use jackson objectMapper to convert an object to the Map.class type
			(2) Update DBï¼š
					tacoOrderInserter.execute(values);
				OR
					long orderId = orderInserter.executeAndReturnKey(values).longValue();

				The second one needs the DB to auto-create the id, and we need the auto-created id.
